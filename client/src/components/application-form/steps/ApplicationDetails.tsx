                    HCSS-East: Chicopee, Ludlow, West Springfield, and Springfield

                    Only students who live in these districts receive preference to that specific school and not to the other (unless you live in West Springfieldâ€”then you have preference to both schools). Any resident of Massachusetts, including students who may be homeless, are eligible to apply and to attend HCSS East or West.
